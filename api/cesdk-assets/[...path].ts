/**
 * DEACTIVATED ROUTE
 * 
 * This file is intentionally left without a default export to prevent it from being
 * treated as a Vercel Serverless Function.
 *
 * REASON FOR DEACTIVATION:
 * This file's name '[...path].ts' creates a route conflict with its sibling
 * '[[...path]].ts'. The double-bracket (optional catch-all) version is the
 * correct and active handler as it covers all necessary asset paths for the
 * CreativeEditor SDK proxy.
 *
 * This file can be safely deleted from the project.
